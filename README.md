# LRU Cache Implementation (Java)(still working)

## Description
This project implements an **LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache** using  
Hashmap + Doubly Linked List** to achieve **O(1)** time complexity for `get` and `put` operations.

## Features
- O(1) access and update
- Automatic eviction of least recently used element
- Clean and modular Java code

## Data Structures Used
- HashMap
- Doubly Linked List

## Time Complexity
- get(): O(1)
- put(): O(1)

## Use Cases
- Operating systems
- Browsers
- Database caching
